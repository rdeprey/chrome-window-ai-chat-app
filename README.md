# Chat with Google's Gemini Nano Model via Chrome's Upcoming window.ai API

This is a simple chat application built with React and Vite that uses Google Chrome's upcoming `window.ai` API to let users chat with the Gemini Nano model.

**To run this application, you must use Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary for now. The feature is still in development and hasn't been widely released through the regular Chrome browser yet.**

## Building the App Locally

### Run Storybook to View Components

Run the command `npm run storybook` to run Storybook locally, where you can interact with the chat application via the `TextChat` component.
