[Try the app in Chrome Dev/Canary](https://66c278cdf0169f008826606a--chrome-window-ai-chat-app.netlify.app/?path=/story/textchat--text-chat-example)

This is a simple chat application built with React and Vite that uses Google Chrome's upcoming `window.ai` API to let users chat with the Gemini Nano model.

**To run this application, you must use Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary for now. The feature is still in development and hasn't been widely released through the regular Chrome browser yet.**
